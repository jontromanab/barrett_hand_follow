This package is for controlling the barrett hand with follow_joint_trajectory action.

This package receives commands from followJointTrajectoryGoal and executes them on /bhand_node/command topic which takes sensor_msgs/JointState.

So this is not only for Gazebo, This works for the Real Hardware too.
